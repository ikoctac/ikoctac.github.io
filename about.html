                    <h1>Calculator's Local Web Storage Usage</h1>
                    <p>Our calculator utilizes local web storage to enhance your experience. This means that any materials you input are stored locally on your device, allowing you to access your stats without the need for creating an account.</p>
            
                    <h2>How it Works:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>No Account Needed:</strong> You don't have to create an account to use the calculator. Your data is stored locally within your browser.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Convenient Access:</strong> Your materials and stats remain accessible whenever you revisit the site, providing seamless continuity for your projects.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Privacy and Security:</strong> Rest assured, your information stays on your device, ensuring your privacy. We do not access or store your data on any external servers.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h2>Considerations:</h2>
                    
                    <p>Please consider the following aspects regarding the usage of local web storage:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Device Specific:</strong> This feature is device-specific. Your stored materials will only be accessible on the device and browser where they were originally input.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Limited Cross-Device Access:</strong> If you use multiple devices, the stored materials will not be available across different devices or browsers. This feature is ideal for users primarily using a single device or browser.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h2>Why Local Web Storage?</h2>
                    <p>We understand the importance of convenience and privacy. Local web storage offers a hassle-free way to retain your materials without the complexities of account creation or concerns about data security.</p>
                    <p>While it may not benefit users who frequently switch devices, it's a convenient solution for those who prefer not to create accounts for every online service they use.</p>
                    <p>Utilizing this feature allows you to effortlessly manage your projects and materials whenever you return to our calculator.</p>
